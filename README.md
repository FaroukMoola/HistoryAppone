The purpose of the app 

The app’s principal aim is to make users acquainted with significant personalities whose ending was at a particular age. The app seeks to reveal the hidden aspect of history by making it more available and exciting to the history enthusiasts and the merely curious, alike. When people input living years, there is an opportunity for the person to dig into what those years may have meant and gain a newfound respect for the role of aging in life.


The app deals with the key functionality the user will be interested in - checking the age the historical person has entered in a database. The app is very user-friendly with a minimalist design that is neat and tidy without the invasion of too many elements. The 'Check' button is the centre point of the app, where users can review an astrology reading as well as other information about historical figures that are dying at the above mentioned age range.


The app incorporates a 'Clear' button in an effort to create remarkable user experience for the user, thus allowing them to easily start a new search. This function is effective if aged input is not exactly historical figure age, for then that message will kind happen to the user ' No one of a historical person was found at this age ' .Please try again.'


The app's design would operate on a back end able to handle a very wide range of ages, from very young to very old. Historical personality matches are checked by searching the available age and other relevant details. The collected materials are arranged in the app's comprehensive database, which caters to a wide spectrum of influential figures, including politicians, scientists, artists, and athletes.
Desing Considerations 
The app's design centers around simplicity and usability. The user interface is easily navigable, offering step-by-step guidance with no unnecessary clutter. The key functionality of the app is the 'Check' button that, when clicked, shows the description about the historical person who died at the age entered.

For a good user interface, the app also includes a 'Clear' button, which makes it easy for the user to start new search instantly. This feature comes particularly in handy when the entered age did not correspond to a historical figure at all, as the app will politely state: 'No historical person was found at this age.Please try again.'

The app's backend is designed to provide a wide spectrum of users ages, from very young to very old. It examines the submitted age against a history database and provides the corresponding data if there is a match. The app's database holds information on a diverse group of famous figures, such as politicians, scientists, artists, and athletes.

The error handling and exception patterns are also part of the app design. As an illustration, the app will display an error message if the user enters an invalid value which is not numerical. Another case is that if the entered age is outside the age range in the database then the app will give a friendly notice that 'The entered age is outside of the age range in our database'.Please try again.'
GitHub Utilization 

This app is hosted on GitHub which is a widely used platform for version control and collaboration. GitHub helps coders to take control of the app's codebase, which alleviates the complicated task of tracking changes, debugging, and adding new features. The resources contain the entire Markdown content along with images and videos sources.

The repository consists of a TOC created by the markdownlint tool, which is used to identify mistakes in Markdown documents. Hence it ensures that app's documentation is forever error-free and easy to understand.

Further, the issue tracking and pull request feature from GitHub are used to manage the content of the app version updates. This enables a joint input in the process of the app’s development by designers, users and programmers, who can work together to propose and realize changes through an organized and transparent system.

The app's repository contains a detailed README file, which gives an introduction to the app, its purpose, design and maintains the usability. The README file also set out directions on locally setting up and running the app, as well as it contains info about the app’s dependencies and requirements.

The repository combines a CONTRIBUTING file for the procedure of contributing to the app's development as well. The file contains info like app's code style, test requirements and versioning strategy.
GitHub Actions 
GitHub Actions is a magnificent automation utility which aids a developer to build specific workflows for their projects. With GitHub Actions, developers can automate designated tasks like coding, testing, and deploying, and it also supports actions such as packaging, notifying team members, and many more.

The fact that GitHub Actions comes preinstalled with GitHub means that you can easily generate workflows by triggering the workflows mechanisms when there are code pushes, pull requests, and issues. It can be accessed in such a way that enables you to automate the tasks that are related to your Github repository when the code is updated. Therefore, the workflows you set up will be consistent and up to the latest code.

The large number of advantages GitHub Actions provides includes being adaptable. With GitHub Actions, you will be able to create personalized and custom workflows that will address exactly your demands. You may use whatever genetic engineering method or tool that you want and, furthermore, it is easy to integrate with various platforms like Slack, Twitter or email.

GitHub Actions apart from having a great feature of workflow management, also provides a rich set of features that help manage workflow, as well. You could watch the condition of your workflows as time passes, and you could solve any problem that crosses your path by simply acting on it. Furthermore, GitHub has logs and metrics that go into the details, and this will help you to optimize your workflows and thereby, improve ongoing development process.

Eventually, Github Actions is that you have a strong instrument of your daily routines of development and your productivity then increases. Whether it be a small project or an intricate enterprise application, GitHub Actions acts as a modern day solution, providing the exact flexibility and power needed to speed up your development process and closing the road to delivering high-quality code 
Conclusion 
In brief, the app is a priceless tool both for those who desire to understand past and those who are studying the phenomenon of aging. Creating the app, which features a user-centered approach and harnesses easy to use features, is intended to ensure that users can quickly and conveniently access the information they require while the back-end is programmed to be capable of serving different ages with appropriately historic figures.


Additionally, implementing the use of GitHub for version control and collaboration in the process increases the applications flexibility and features up another level. By hosting the app on GitHub, developers can conveniently trace any changes, eliminate bugs, and include new functionalities easily. To add up, the app's development relies on GitHub's issue tracking and pull request features, so that there is an option to apply a collaborative approach to releasing updates and fixes, with users and developers able to do propose and implement changes in a structured and transparent manner.


In general, the app is a nice and interactive resource which is able to mimic the whole historical experience appeal. It enjoys the features of two powerful tools: simplicity and elegance of the design and the flexibility of GitHub. Therefore, it seems to be a great one for history buffs and those who care about the impact of aging. Either, you are a history buff or just someone who likes to know more about African American Civil Rights movement, this app will make sure that you have a very uplifting and educational journey.
